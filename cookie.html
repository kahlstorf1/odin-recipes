       <h2><strong>Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies</strong></h2>
       
       <ul>
        2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br><br>
        1 tsp baking soda<br><br>
        1/2 tsp Salt<br><br>
        1 cup unsalted butter<br><br>
        1 1/2 cups brown sugar (packed)<br><br>
        1/4 cup granulated sugar<br><br>
        1 large egg + 1 egg yolk<br><br>
        1 tbsp vanilla extract<br><br>
        1 tbsp plain greek yogurt<br><br>
        3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips<br><br>
        3/4 cup milk chocolate chips<br><br>
        Kosher salt, for garnish

        <h6><em>Makes 20-28 cookies</em></h6>
       </ul>

       <h4>Directions</h4>
    
        <ol>
        <strong>1: </strong>Heat non-stick sauce pan to medium. Add butter, whisking frequently. Butter will begin to crack and foam.
        After 2-3 minutes, butter will begin to turn golden-amber color. As soon as butter begins to brown and smells nutty,
        remove from heat and transfer to bowl to cool. <strong>Frequently mix during this whole step, or butter will easily burn.</strong><br><br>
        <strong>2: </strong>Once butter cooled, mix butter with sugars until well combined. Add egg, egg yolk, vanilla, and greek yogurt until combined.<br><br>
        <strong>3: </strong>In separate bowl, add dry ingredients (flour, baking soda, non-kosher salt) until combined. Slowly incorporate
        both wet and dry together, adding dry to wet until fully combined. Add both chocolate chip and mix just until incorporated.<br><br>
        <strong>4: </strong>Chill dough for at least 2-3 hours, up to 24 hours in the fridge.<br><br>
        <strong>5: </strong>With chilled dough, preheat oven to 350 degrees F and form cookies on tray. Cookies should be about 2 heaping tbsp.
        Bake for 9-11 minutes, let cool for 5 minutes, then sprinkle with kosher salt.<br><br>

        Enjoy!
