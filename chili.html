        1/4 cup apple cider vinegar<br>
        1 tbsp brown sugar<br>
        1 tbsp favorite hot sauce<br><br>
        <em>Salt and Pepper to taste</em>
       </ul>
       For Garnish (optional):
       <ul>
        Cheddar Cheese, grated<br>
        Onion, diced<br>
        Scallions, sliced thin<br>
        jalapeno, diced<br>
       </ul>

       <h4>Directions</h4>
    
        <ol>
        <strong>1: </strong>Heat dutch oven to medium-high, add oil until shimmering.
        Sear short ribs, browning on all sides, about 8-10 minutes. Once done remove and let rest.<br><br>
        <strong>2: </strong>While short rib cooking, combine chipotle in adobo, garam masala, chocolate, coffee,
        soy sauce, and half of chicken broth to a blender. Blend until mixture turns into smooth paste.<br><br>
        <strong>3: </strong>Chop short rib into 1/4 to 1/2 inch pieces, set aside.<br><br>
        <strong>4: </strong>Heat 4 tbsp vegetable oil in dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onions, salt,
        and let cook for 6-7 minutes, stirring frequently. Once soft, add garlic and jalapeno, stirring frequently for
        1 minute. Add chipotle paste and cook, 2 to 4 minutes. Add chopped short rib, rest of chicken broth, and bring
        to simmer. Once simmering, reduce heat to lowest possible and cook 1 hour, with lid ajar. Add beans, tomatoes and cider
        vinegar and cook, fully covered, for 2 to 3 hours, or until meat is fully tender. Add extra broth or water if
        liquid needed. <br><br>
        <strong>5: </strong>Cut heat, add brown sugar and hot sauce and mix to combine. Season to taste with salt, pepper, and
        extra vinegar if desired.<br><br>
        Enjoy!
